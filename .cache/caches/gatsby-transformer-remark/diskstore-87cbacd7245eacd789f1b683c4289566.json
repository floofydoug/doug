Australian Fires. Apartment shopping. RIP Kobe. Trump tries to replace NAFTA. Our startup had to pivot because a big contract we were expecting to get signed fell through. I’m starting to pack my stuff from Overland into boxes.\nFebruary - Dennis is in town to shoot an episode of Hot Seat. Naomi, Dennis and I get Popeyes and see Darude play Sandstorm. We hear about Covid in the US for the first time. I move to my new apartment on Valentine’s Day and try to get everything set up before I fly back to VA for Justin and Whitney’s wedding.\nMarch -  No toilet paper. I had a ski trip planned with a coworker in Tahoe, but we only got to snowboard once because the resorts shutdown in response to the virus. I also miss my flight back because of excess snow. Grandma dies. Stocks start to fall. I officially start WFH for good and I start learning how to play Rocket League and Dungeons and Dragons. My portfolio looks absolutely terrible and I start to doubt whether or not cryptocurrencies are viable at all because they’ve fallen directly with the current market.\nApril - Some online friends whom I have never met in real life mail me toilet paper! Praise all Dungeons and Dragons friend groups. WFH and lockdowns ensue. I print out a large Fairfax County map to go along with my parks map that Vivian sent me. I try to grow some bonsai trees that Bernard sent me and I kill them all. Bernard and Andrea gets married.\nMay - started off pretty strong! While Covid was raging, scientists found a way to stop the spread of Malaria! But then it looked like China was going to war with India for a moment and then there was the murder of George Floyd. There were riots in LA and I’d wake up in the middle of the night to helicopters yelling at people on Venice Blvd. I buy a piano.\nJune - Elon Musk and his team is Atlas bearing the weight of human paralysis and launches 60 satellates for Starlink. TSLA stock is infallible, being above 1K for the first time. I manage to lose 8K in options trading on Robinhood when everything seemed to be going back up. BLM still protesting. I drive down to Lake Forest to celebrate Lynsa’s birthday and write letters back to friends and family at home. Dgon invited me to check out the death of OGN Gaming during their liquidation sale and I purchase two Secret Labs chairs for $50 and an Uplift Desk for $200. I start rock climbing outdoors with Daniel Bui and my indoor rock climbing subscription starts sneakily charging me again even though they were only open for a week before closures again. I learn to play happy birthday on the piano to play for myself in a minor key.\nJuly - I’m convinced Putin will be ruler for life. I get really into rock climbing. I’m going whenever i get an invite and I still haven’t sent my first climb yet, but 6 months of sloth and gluttony is hard to shake off. Mom sends me ramen in a care package and I didn’t eat it because it’s such a nice thoughtful gift from Mom.\nAugust - I buy my own crashpad so I can start climbing multiple times a week on my own. I start sending my first v1s this time. Crystal and Elbert join me for some of my trips. One day I get really sunburnt at Manhatten beach, and I get inspired to go home after a couple video call sessions with Matt, James, Vivian and Ivy. I think I felt a little homesick and I’d been looking at a lot of property in Virginia as well as ideating on an idea to ship quarters to people in quarantine with fresh ones from the mint. I quarantine at Sami’s and we have a lot of fun playing minecraft and catching up and ideating new startups. The trip is fun, but I realize everyone’s dealing with the virus differently and Virginia isn’t so fun anymore. My friends don’t hang out with each other anymore and are moving on with life. But I don’t make this conclusion before buying a bike, fixing it and asking Vivian to hang out one last time to see if this could ever work. I give up. Work sends me an amazing cake to celebrate my 1 year.\nSeptember - On the way back to LA, I start downloading a bunch of dating apps. I’d just seen my parents. I can be more outgoing and still be mostly responsible as long as I get tested regularly. I visit Lamanh’s place in the Art’s District and accidentally drive through Skid Row. I help test Crystal’s online shop and Alex Craven visits me in LA. We purchase edibles and marijuana for the first time in CA and I get stung by a bee on the throat. Online dating is pretty fun. I brought a girl to Stoney to climb and she ended up going home with a different guy! I start playing more tennis. Hang outs with Susie, Stephanie, and Jimmy. Suga replaces Abe Shinzo but continues Abeconomics in Japan. World covid death-toll at 1,000,0000 dead. I hit Plat in Rocket League.\nOctober - Lamanh and Alex come out to climb. Jacinda Adern wins New Zealand’s hearts. Susie introduces me to a climber friend who is my current go-to climbing buddy. Uncle Pete buys CovidDefeatsTrump.com, I get my California Real Id, I go on my third date with Erica, and Arivan visits me and we go climbing. He’s missing some teeth from a surfing accident a week prior. I learn that the rest of the engineering team is leaving to start their own companies. I convince Sami to fly out to interview with Entermedicare. Sami accepts the offer, and we celebrate by playing Civ 6 and dressing up in Kigus to buy weed on Halloween. My boss and CEO at Entermedicare decides to be patient 0 for Moderna Vaccine trials.\nNovember - I regret not investing in Moderna. Iran’s top nuclear scientist is assassinated. I climb with Chris and attempt my first v3. Erica invites to me a cabin in the woods to try mushrooms for a spiritial experience with a shaman. Im convinced it is a cult trying to kill me and I go. I survive. Work transitions as I feel like I’m the only engineer on the team. Sami starts the week before Thanksgiving. Spend Thanksgiving with Erica and her friends. We buy food from Whole Foods deli (their thanksgiving food is actually delicious). My aunt and uncle in Lake Forest contract covid.\nDecember - A more infectious strain of covid is found. Bitcoin > 30K. I go snowboarding with Alex Craven and a former marine in Colorado. Both Libertarians. EnterMedicare raises another small 3M round. I fly home and quarantine with Sami and surprise my parents for Christmas Eve after getting a test. Nashville gets hit with a small bomb. And as a small way to end 2020, I get a speeding ticket going to the airport, Dennis hits a garage door during a test drive, Erica gets a flat tire, her friend is towed, and I had to jumpstart her prius today! I foresee lots of car issues into 2021!","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":206},"end":{"line":17,"column":590,"offset":6860}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1,"offset":206},"end":{"line":17,"column":590,"offset":6860}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Update: January 2021 - turns out the startup I’m in is also is looking to get acquired.
