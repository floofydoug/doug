I bought this domain for 5 years. The Chinese aren’t stealing dougphung.com again for awhile!</p>\n<p>Oh woe. 2019 was exciting, with lots of ups and lots of downs.\nI said good-bye to so many good friends back in DC, and I’ve made a few friends in LA.</p>\n<p>Love wasn’t in the Californian air when I got here.

But 2 weeks later I had a new job.</p>\n<p><strong>January</strong>-Went snowboarding with the bestest of friends.</p>\n<p><strong>February</strong>-Submitted my two weeks notice to Capital One.

Spent Christmas surfing in El Salvador and Costa Rica while attending Nga and Pete’s 25th anniversary vow renewal.</p>\n<p><strong>Books Read This Year</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A Testament of Hope: Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King Jr.</li>\n<li>Animal Farm, George Orwell</li>\n<li>Reinventing American Health Care, Ezekiel J. Emanuel</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Favorite Songs of 2019</strong> (not repeating the 2018 ones):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izRqdNeTYbE\">You’ve Got Your Whole Life Ahead Of You, IDER</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izRqdNeTYbE\">Sun In our Eyes, MØ</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OFv566mj7s\">Rainbow, Kacey Musgraves</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ1OGXxb6PM\">Winnebago, Gryffin ft. Quinn XCII, Daniel Wison</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM-BakWpN4k\">Cinnamon Girl, ASL</a></li>\n<li>Send Me Off, Bastille. Added this last minute because I played it while writing this. Actually, the entirety of Golden Hour by Kacey Musgraves is good. I also really like the title Space Cowboy since it feels so Cowboy Bebop, even though it isn’t jazz funk. It reminds me of Julia Blues.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Resolutions:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>I didn’t get as strong as I wanted to, but I did lift more weights in 2019. I think I may try a personal trainer in 2020. But I resolve to be stronger.</li>\n<li>I really enjoyed El Salvador and the hostels in Costa Rica. I will try to travel solo again in 2020.</li>\n<li>I miss ultimate frisbee. I will play more. Beach Pickups, here I come!</li>\n<li>Try to blog more often. My instagram daily posts only worked for 30-odd days.</li>\n<li>Explore more of LA. I haven’t been to a concert here!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Predictions and Politics:</strong></p>\n<p>In 2013 I predicted we’d have a half asian woman president for 2020. I’m beginning to think Bernie-Warren with Yang ideas is the best I’m going to get. But I also predicted war starting in 2020.</p>\n<p>America’s started the year with assassinations. Let us remember Asimov, “Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent”. Here’s to getting through the year with minimal bloodshed globally.</p>"}
