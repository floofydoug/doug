The bridge of my nose is a bit sore from the chinese knockoff N95 mask I promised Mom I’d wear.</p>\n<p>I bought the saddest looking burrito from a Moe’s and I watched a racist Karen get kicked off a plane headed to Tulsa, OK. She demanded she be reimbursed, wanted a hotel, and pulled her mask off and coughed at the gate attendant. When airport security came to arrest her, she started crying. Maybe I’m no better. Afterall, a good libtard should be at home, curtains drawn when not protesting. Here I am at the airport… going home to see friends and family. Living in Los Angeles has no merits when both the Hollywood and Michelin stars are permanently closed. I’ve been working from home since late February. Almost half a year indoors.</p>\n<p>Recently in the past 6 weeks, I’ve gotten into outdoor climbing. I’ll head up 2-3 times a week from Culver City up to Stoney Point, where in the documentary Valley Uprising, the origins of rockclimbing took its roots. It feels good to know at least with this, I’m following in the footsteps of some great leaders. With all the gyms closed this year, I’ve been a part of the Great Muscle Deflation that’s hit this country as bad as the recent increase in inflation.</p>\n<p>I didn’t think I’d ever get to this point, but I think I’ve played an entire lifetime’s worth of video games and I don’t really find them to have the same appeal. Maybe my Buddhist moderation has really kicked in. Maybe I’m just bad at Dota and am tired of losing. At any rate, I’ve uninstalled most of my games.</p>\n<p>I just finished reading Viet Thanh Nguyen’s The Sympathizer. I originally bought it to read on this trip, but I cheated and read a few pages before the trip and was hooked. I don’t know why I am so enthralled by the revolutionary. I love Gurren Lagann, Akame Ga Kill, Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Princess Leia. Hah. Maybe it’s just a wish that the underdog gets a more equal share. Maybe i wished ultimate frisbee could get more playing time on the fields, but we can’t because we’re not considered a “real” or a “primary” sport.</p>\n<p>The hardest part of the revolutionary’s job is to convince their peers that the cause is worth it. Maybe that is why I like startups. The founding members are no different than cult leaders. Maybe the only difference is that the founders do not convene with God. Maybe they do… WeWork was almost granted divinity next to the holiest Apple and Google and Facebook and Netflix. And at wework, CEO worship was mandatory. But it’s grueling work.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I’m going home to Virginia. I need to figure out if I should go home to NOVA, Travel the world during a pandemic, settle down in the south and get a dog, or start my own business. I like my current job, and they’ve allowed me to work remotely. But my rent in LA is very high. I could just be a big fish in a small pond. No need to have to live near Kylie Jenner. At the end of the day I’m only a step further in this climb. I need to kick it in gear to do a full send.</p>"}
