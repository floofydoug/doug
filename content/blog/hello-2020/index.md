This is my first post on my new blog. I bought this domain for 5 years. The Chinese aren't stealing dougphung.com again for awhile!

Oh woe. 2019 was exciting, with lots of ups and lots of downs.
I said good-bye to so many good friends back in DC, and I've made few friends in LA.

Love wasn't in the California when I got here. I experienced a lay-off / firing for the first time. But 2 weeks later I had a new job.

January-Went snowboarding with the bestest of friends.
February-Submitted my two weeks notice to Capital One. Crystal moved to LA. I slept on an air mattress.
March-I had two final round interviews in California, but it didn't work out.
April-I drove cross-country with my Dad across America. Visited some great friends along the way and saw family.
May-Got a job at a luxury real estate startup making a website engine.
June-Went bottom-fishing on a boat and caught the limit!
July-Sarah and friends were in town for Anime Expo. 7.4 earthquake.
August-Celebrated the release of v3 at work by parting at Kylie Jenner's new house (the startup had the real estate agent's keys), but I was let go the next day.
September-Started working at EnterMedicare, a medicare startup. Started learning more indepth about America's healthcare environment. Got to visit home for a week before I started and played the first week of Fairfax Ultimate's Fall League.
October-James Lee came down. and Jtow came to visit and we drove down to see club nationals.
November-Thanksgiving was spent with Cousins down in Long Beach. Shut down Wishpanda.
December-Crystal and I broke up after 3 years 11 months. Spent Christmas surfing in El Salvador and Costa Rica while attending Nga and Pete's 25th anniversary vow renewal.

Resolutions:

1. I didn't get as strong as I wanted to, but I did lift more weights in 2019. I think I may try a personal trainer in 2020. But I resolve to be stronger.
2. I really enjoyed El Salvador and the hostels in Costa Rica. I will try to travel solo again in 2020.
3. I miss ultimate frisbee. I will play more.
4. Try to blog more often. My instagram daily posts only worked for 30-odd days.
5. Explore more of LA.
