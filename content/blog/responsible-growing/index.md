It takes courage to try something new,\
I used to inspire others to break their comfort zone,\
Ninety-nine problems,\
but I'm not alone,\
Put my heart on the line, dance to the music,\
Now I'm becoming real again.\
\
Mama said to take care of myself and help others in need,\
So put the excuses back on the shelf,\
and put one foot in front the other towards a new goal,\
Even the airlines say help yourself before the others.\
\
Dont be afraid of the unknown,\
Creating hope used to be my philosophy,\
A navy seal told me,\
*If you want to change the world,\
Swim with the sharks and make your bed regularly*\
Now I'm stepping outside my comfort zone again.\
\
Gravity exists because it's afraid of letting go,\
but the natural state of man is to be free.\
So I believe it's okay to push the status quo,\
But first, don't forget to take care of yourself.
