The bridge of my nose is a bit sore from the chinese knockoff N95 mask I promised Mom I’d wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the saddest looking burrito from a Moe’s and I watched a racist Karen get kicked off a plane headed to Tulsa, OK. She demanded she be reimbursed, wanted a hotel, and pulled her mask off and coughed at the gate attendant. When airport security came to arrest her, she started crying. Maybe I’m no better. Afterall, a good libtard should be at home, curtains drawn when not protesting. Here I am at the airport… going home to see friends and family. Living in Los Angeles has no merits when both the Hollywood and Michelin stars are permanently closed. I’ve been working from home since late February. Almost half a year indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently in the past 6 weeks, I’ve gotten into outdoor climbing. I’ll head up 2-3 times a week from Culver City up to Stoney Point, where in the documentary Valley Uprising, the origins of rockclimbing took its roots. It feels good to know at least with this, I’m following in the footsteps of some great leaders. With all the gyms closed this year, I’ve been a part of the Great Muscle Deflation that’s hit this country as bad as the recent increase in inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think I’d ever get to this point, but I think I’ve played an entire lifetime’s worth of video games and I don’t really find them to have the same appeal. Maybe my Buddhist moderation has really kicked in. Maybe I’m just bad at Dota and am tired of losing. At any rate, I’ve uninstalled most of my games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading Viet Thanh Nguyen’s The Sympathizer. I originally bought it to read on this trip, but I cheated and read a few pages before the trip and was hooked. I don’t know why I am so enthralled by the revolutionary. I love Gurren Lagann, Akame Ga Kill, Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Princess Leia. Hah. Maybe it’s just a wish that the underdog gets a more equal share. Maybe i wished ultimate frisbee could get more playing time on the fields, but we can’t because we’re not considered a “real” or a “primary” sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of the revolutionary’s job is to convince their peers that the cause is worth it. Maybe that is why I like startups. The founding members are no different than cult leaders. Maybe the only difference is that the founders do not convene with God. Maybe they do… WeWork was almost granted divinity next to the holiest Apple and Google and Facebook and Netflix. And at wework, CEO worship was mandatory. But it’s grueling work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I’m going home to Virginia. I need to figure out if I should go home to NOVA, Travel the world during a pandemic, settle down in the south and get a dog, or start my own business. I like my current job, and they’ve allowed me to work remotely. But my rent in LA is very high. I could just be a big fish in a small pond. No need to have to live near Kylie Jenner. At the end of the day I’m only a step further in this climb. I need to kick it in gear to do a full send.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Responsible Growing]]></title><description><![CDATA[It takes courage to try something new, I used to inspire others to break their comfort zone, Ninety-nine problems, but I’m not alone, Put my…]]></description><link>http://www.dougphung.com/responsible-growing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.dougphung.com/responsible-growing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 05:54:28 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It takes courage to try something new,&lt;br&gt;
I used to inspire others to break their comfort zone,&lt;br&gt;
Ninety-nine problems,&lt;br&gt;
but I’m not alone,&lt;br&gt;
Put my heart on the line, dance to the music,&lt;br&gt;
Now I’m becoming real again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Mama said to take care of myself and help others in need,&lt;br&gt;
So put the excuses back on the shelf,&lt;br&gt;
and put one foot in front the other towards a new goal,&lt;br&gt;
Even the airlines say help yourself before the others.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dont be afraid of the unknown,&lt;br&gt;
Creating hope used to be my philosophy,&lt;br&gt;
A navy seal told me,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If you want to change the world,&lt;br&gt;
Swim with the sharks and make your bed regularly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now I’m stepping outside my comfort zone again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Gravity exists because it’s afraid of letting go,&lt;br&gt;
but the natural state of man is to be free.&lt;br&gt;
So I believe it’s okay to push the status quo,&lt;br&gt;
But first, don’t forget to take care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wasted Time]]></title><description><![CDATA[Why get out of bed?

If you don’t make promises,&lt;br&gt;
You can’t break any.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello 2020]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is my first post on my new blog. I bought this domain for 5 years.

I bought this domain for 5 years. The Chinese aren’t stealing dougphung.com again for awhile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh woe. 2019 was exciting, with lots of ups and lots of downs.
I said good-bye to so many good friends back in DC, and I’ve made a few friends in LA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love wasn’t in the Californian air when I got here. And I experienced a lay-off / firing for the first time. But 2 weeks later I had a new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January&lt;/strong&gt;-Went snowboarding with the bestest of friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February&lt;/strong&gt;-Submitted my two weeks notice to Capital One. Crystal moved to LA. I slept on an air mattress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March&lt;/strong&gt;-I had two final round interviews in California, but it didn’t work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April&lt;/strong&gt;-I drove cross-country with my Dad across America. Visited some great friends along the way and saw family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May&lt;/strong&gt;-Got a job at a luxury real estate startup making a website engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June&lt;/strong&gt;-Went bottom-fishing on a boat and caught the limit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July&lt;/strong&gt;-Sarah and friends were in town for Anime Expo. 7.4 earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August&lt;/strong&gt;-Celebrated the release of v3 at work by parting at Kylie Jenner’s new house (the startup had the real estate agent’s keys), but I was let go the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September&lt;/strong&gt;-Started working at EnterMedicare, a medicare startup. Started learning more indepth about America’s healthcare environment. Got to visit home for a week before I started and played the first week of Fairfax Ultimate’s Fall League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October&lt;/strong&gt;-James Lee came down. and Jtow came to visit and we drove down to see USAU club nationals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November&lt;/strong&gt;-Thanksgiving was spent with Cousins down in Long Beach. Shut down Wishpanda. Attended my first NBA game. Clippers vs Trailblazers @StapleCenter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December&lt;/strong&gt;-Crystal and I broke up after 3 years 11 months. Spent Christmas surfing in El Salvador and Costa Rica while attending Nga and Pete’s 25th anniversary vow renewal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books Read This Year&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Testament of Hope: Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animal Farm, George Orwell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinventing American Health Care, Ezekiel J. Emanuel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Songs of 2019&lt;/strong&gt; (not repeating the 2018 ones):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izRqdNeTYbE&quot;&gt;You’ve Got Your Whole Life Ahead Of You, IDER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izRqdNeTYbE&quot;&gt;Sun In our Eyes, MØ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OFv566mj7s&quot;&gt;Rainbow, Kacey Musgraves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ1OGXxb6PM&quot;&gt;Winnebago, Gryffin ft. Quinn XCII, Daniel Wison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM-BakWpN4k&quot;&gt;Cinnamon Girl, ASL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send Me Off, Bastille. Added this last minute because I played it while writing this. Actually, the entirety of Golden Hour by Kacey Musgraves is good. I also really like the title Space Cowboy since it feels so Cowboy Bebop, even though it isn’t jazz funk. It reminds me of Julia Blues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolutions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn’t get as strong as I wanted to, but I did lift more weights in 2019. I think I may try a personal trainer in 2020. But I resolve to be stronger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed El Salvador and the hostels in Costa Rica. I will try to travel solo again in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I miss ultimate frisbee. I will play more. Beach Pickups, here I come!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to blog more often. My instagram daily posts only worked for 30-odd days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore more of LA. I haven’t been to a concert here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictions and Politics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 I predicted we’d have a half asian woman president for 2020. I’m beginning to think Bernie-Warren with Yang ideas is the best I’m going to get. But I also predicted war starting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America’s started the year with assassinations. Let us remember Asimov, “Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent”. Here’s to getting through the year with minimal bloodshed globally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
