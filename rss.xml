I go about setting this site to be some place I will write my thoughts, but I end up having to completely change up the hosting each year because things get deprecated throughout the year. Dougphung.com was unavailable for half the year because the hosting provider went out of business!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;January&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started off the new year with a bang. Someone once told me that once an athelete hits their thirties, everyone experiences &quot;The Injury&quot; and its a big deciding factor whether or not they&apos;ll still be active. I managed to dislocate my shoulder pretty bad out in Solitude, Utah while snowboarding. I had a Hill-Sachs lesion and a labral tear from trying to do a jump I had done a couple times already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once the shoulder was back in, we kept shredding! we got a crazy amount of snow, something like 48 inches over the week, and got snowed in. We had to build makeshift ramps from woodplanks and all took turns backing out the cars because it was a 2+ hr effort some days to get the cars out. We missed the heated driveway back in Colorado in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got back to Austin, I started a healthcare meetup, moved to a new studio close to downtown Austin by the Crux Climbing gym, and experienced a crazy icestorm that took out most of Austin&apos;s power for 3 full days. I was lucky enough to have internet and power, but Sami was not. He had to sleep over a couple of the days. We were still figuring out how to navigate work, but eventually settled on alternating development days at each other&apos;s places. One of my cousins just had a newborn baby, Lennox,(I&apos;m an uncle!) and they tried going to a hotel and there wasn&apos;t power there either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had to start training for a half marathon. So around this time I was trying to run a little bit, and managed to join Josh Cruz for a couple of his shorter sessions since he was training for the full marathon. I got one 10 mile session in and was completely drained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;February&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Han and Mary were in town. I watched a super bowl over at Josh&apos;s while trying to figure out if Moyae was ever going to launch fully. Things were a little bit tough at this point. We had a pilot program the year prior, but it was the second month in the year, and we had no new information about what was going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will probably be my life&apos;s best poop story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weekend of the 18th, Daniel and Emily flew in and I stupidly had a boozy milkshake at a boardgame cafe called &quot;vigilante&quot; the night prior. I&apos;m lactose and alcohol intolerant. We were supposed to wake up at 4:30am to head over to the starting line, but at 3:30am my stomach was still growling and I was passing enough gas to solve all of Europe&apos;s pipeline disputes. I had no sleep and am a shy pooper. Because my studio had no bathroom fan and Daniel and Emily were staying over I thought I could use one of the bathrooms prior to the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But once we parked and started warming up, none of the portable bathrooms were available, and I wasn&apos;t sure it would&apos;ve been wise to &quot;unplug&quot; myself anyways. We started the race going really really slow. I think the first mile split was close to 12 minutes. Two miles in I was still cropdusting the whole race and was deathly afraid of letting out anything more than just gas because I was wearing white frisbee shorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t stop for any water breaks until the halfway point, and with each mile, I was getting more dehydrated and feeling a lot better! By the last mile, my split was in the low 7s. I finished and finally took a normal poo afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We gorged on BBQ afterwards and I packed up to go to San Francisco for John Huynh&apos;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco I stayed at Daniel Won&apos;s place but he was out of town.  I rented a car and was given a free upgrade to a BMW because the battery needed running. Some friends were also in town for the wedding and I remember I had to bribe a bouncer $80 to get into a club because the venue was sold out and I didn&apos;t have tickets but some friends had a table. We celebrated John and Jina, had drinks at an Irish pub afterwards and visited Jina Bakes and the newlywed&apos;s home the following day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got back to Austin, my parents were in town to help my cousin adjust to the parenting lifestyle and the too got to see my modest 450 sqft studio. I got to spend some time with them even though I worked throughout most of their stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal government finally awarded Moyae our CHPL number and we were an officially certified EHR for medicare reimbursements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SXSW was going on in Austin, but Sami and I were still building the product after our certification. We visited downtown once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my aunts were in town and I remember taking a bird scooter to a Chinese buffet, but everything this month was a total blur of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dgon Gonzales also visited Austin around this time and he introduced me some streamers and we got Korean BBQ at the new honey pig in Cedar Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started seeing someone for a little bit around this time, but I was working too much for it to work. However, she introduced me to IU... specifically the show My Mister... because she thought I might like it. It taught me a valuable lesson: Real relationships require real time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having celebrity crushes do not! So started my very healthy consumption of IU media and re-introduction to K-Pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried climbing more in April but my shoulder was still feeling bad. I managed to dislocate my shoulder again at the gym and Tim Reyes had to help me put it back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massen, Tim, Christine and I do an impromptu hike at McKinney Falls and I quickly learn that I do not like Texas nature. I thought there was a weird moss growing on some of the rocky caves, but they turned out to be hundreds of daddy long legged spiders clumped together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time Sami and I were still working everyday until about 9pm - 10pm and we joked about World War 3 because tensions with China were rising and Japan announced they would build long range missles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim and Christine introduce me to an awesome pasta place, Artipasta, and it becomes a good place to eat after climbing. We sometimes get Happy Lemon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alison Liu was in town. I managed to drink too much (3 drinks), got soaked, and had to take an uber home. I left my car downtown and had to get the car the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn that the doctors we were working with finally were going to be making a decision so we start preparing a lot of demos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point I&apos;ve watched all of Hotel del Luna 2x over, My Mister 2x, and owned a single IU album.
I don&apos;t have too many pictures from this month unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend from LA moved to Austin and we hike Mt. Bonnell. There were power outages affecting Sami&apos;s place often so we were working more from my place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed up 36 hours working on my 33rd birthday, the 2nd year in a row on my birthday where work likes to punish me. We had heard that launch day for Moyae would be on the 26th of June, so we were working 14-15hr days everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal sent me IU&apos;s latest album and Daniel had sent me IU celebrity polaroids which I hung on my fridge.
This picture is actually from July when my cousin Stephen gave me the Vaporeon plushie, but all of these poloroids were from Daniel and they were my most valuable possession. I&apos;d drive to the clinics in a daze listening to music I didn&apos;t understand trying to remember the features for the demo we had built the night before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first week of launch was chaos. Things were not smooth the first day and there were a couple of production issues in the morning. I honestly do not remember a lot the first couple of weeks after launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of June and July were a blur. Sami and I were waking up at 6:50am to be in the offices by 7:30am or drive an hour to the other location in Taylor, TX and be there by 8:00am, taking notes, providing onsite support, and working until 2am to fix the problems we saw happen during the day. We were working 18-19hr days everyday making sure that every patient&apos;s visit was accounted for and that all the staff in the clinics could do their jobs well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started ordering Factor meals in bulk and would get 18 meals delivered to my house each week. This was all I ate for a couple of months straight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did that for 6 weeks and I managed to get away for a weekend to go to Wildwood. I had not done any physical activity for almost all of June and most of July since I dislocated my shoulder late April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an early flight back to Austin, and Aimee and Duy had to take me home early as I barely made my flight back. I had booked flights at both IAD and BWI and ended up taking the Baltimore flight because it was more likely going to work out. I would&apos;ve missed the Dulles flight. They honestly helped me so much when I was in a pinch this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time I started to get a lot of car trouble. Driving to Taylor one day, a rock hit Kendra&apos;s windshield (Kendra is my gay Subaru Forrester) and cracked a large portion of it. I paid $300 to get it replaced only to find out more bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, it was over 120°F in my car. And eventually Kendra started making noises. I kept putting it off because I had just changed the oil in my car earlier in the year and I did not drive that much. But a mechanic told me that I should sell her because he believed the engine was developing a &quot;knock&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well literally the following day, a gasket blew up and I got stranded on the side of the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I paid $7500 for a new engine and had to use several different Priuses for 3 weeks. Here is Kendra getting towed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sami and I had been applying to a couple different programs around this time because we had just launched officially and the application we had written was no longer trying to kill itself every time a new use case was attempted. At the end of August we were accepted into several different programs, but chose Techstars Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;September&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my monthly health meetings I was hosting at Capital Factory, someone told me a famous ophthalmologist, Dr. Ming Wang, was in town to debut the movie &quot;Sight&quot;, but it was showing only at the local Chinese Church. It was a heartwrenching story (as is every story set around the cultural revolution) so I went and cried my eyes out at church and tried to talk to this doctor. He talked about finding faith and I found myself unsure if I should&apos;ve been praying for more sleep or writing better code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I am listening to Dr. Ming Wang&apos;s testimony in Mandarin not understanding a word, but the movie had subtitles and was mostly in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Rebecca Tong made beautiful ski and snowboard invitations for our 2024 trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;October&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew into Seattle with Sami for a weekend to meet the Techstars program. Sami stayed for Mentor Madness which was an aptly named portion of the program. Sami had to do all of it. I joined in when I could, but over the course of about 3 weeks, we had over 200 different meetings on our calendars. I caught up with my cousin Victor the weekend I visited and he told he&apos;d be in Austin the following week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weirdly, the room I booked was a marked for students, which I had no objection with. But the toilet was in the shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I managed to accomplish a feat I had never thought of trying that weekend too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew back to Austin and I immediately dislocated my shoulder again climbing with Victor at the same gym with the same staff working as before. The climbing gym kindly suggested that I do not return until I was better and suggested cancel my membership because I was a liability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met my cousin Lennox for an extended period now that her immune system was more built up. She is now 10 months old and is beginning to stand on her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billy Hayes and Addison Pock were in town and we did Rainey street and I attended a halloween pumpkin carving party with Peter Thiel adjacent friends. There, I met a Japanese arms dealer and asked if business was good after the Hamas attack on Isreal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;November&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sami and I met up in San Francisco to attend the American Academy of Ophthalmology conference of the world&apos;s ophthalmolgists and we switched places that weekend. After the conference I flew to Washington and rented a spot in Capitol Hill, Seattle. It was a lot of meetings, and at one point we had a production issue and I was not on site to fix it. We decided to hire for a QA testing position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ate out for every meal eating at every asian spot I saw. I had been eating a lot of Factor meals back in Texas and appreciated the new selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techstars had a lot of happy hour events, but around Thanksgiving I flew home. I saw &quot;Cool Crew&quot; (Peter, Naomi, Justin, Dennis... a name given to us by a BGR employee back when they were still around in Clarendon in 2012) and adjacent friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I played in a Fairfax Ultimate frisbee tournament. I tried to throw a hammer in the third game and managed to slip my arm out of its socket once again and this time it wouldn&apos;t go back in as easily. I got home at midnight and woke up at 4:00am to fly at 5:30am back to Seattle with my shoulder still hurting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had axe throwing as a happy hour event a couple days later and I can happily say I managed to hit a bullseye left-handed. I was pretty sure my right arm would&apos;ve just slipped right out again if i just held the axe with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt McMahon came to visit and we stayed inside most nights watching Castlevania and working. I&apos;m sorry I&apos;m such a buzzkill! The one day it did not rain, we went up to the space needle and then Henry Kissinger died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;December&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 5th, Matt left early in the morning and Sami and I caught up for a day and switched places at the Airbnb. I flew back to Austin on the 5th on a redeye and was back in the clinics on the 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December 15th weekend I had Terry Black&apos;s bbq for the first time, my first touristy BBQ spot. IT WAS SO GOOD. If you visit me in Austin, this is where I&apos;m taking you. I don&apos;t know why it took Lily and Massen to drag me here, but I got the beef rib and it was insanely good. I just didn&apos;t expect to spend $93 at 11:00am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time I was mailing socks in the mail to random doctors that owned their own practices hoping they would be interested in switching their system over to us. We needed to prove that there were other practices that would switch over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved to Massen&apos;s house in Round Rock Christmas Eve and the movers I booked didn&apos;t show up. I had to ask my Mexican neighbors early in the morning via google translate if they could help me carry some boxes because my right arm was useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had Christmas dinner with my cousins Lena and Vijay and my niece Lennox. I hadn&apos;t had a home cooked meal since Thanksgiving and the food was delicious.

&lt;p&gt;Massen and I started watching Singles Inferno and got I got hooked. I&apos;d work 12-14 hours then eat late dinner and watch insanely attractive Koreans tried to find love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shot pool at a place near my old place I had just moved from and celebrated the new year at a new friend&apos;s house up in Round Rock. Here&apos;s Mike Pham tearing up the Simpsons Pinball machine at The Marquis, our new favorite billiards spot.

&lt;p&gt;I saw a commercial for the eye clinic we were working with while waiting for New Jeans to perform on TV. A single Smirnoff Ice 3 hours into the party, I concluded this still must be the my life&apos;s best timeline in the multiverse if our doctors had a commercial right before I celebrated the new year with Super Shy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books I read in 2023:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Resolutions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I resolve to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get my shoulder fixed. Potentially involving surgery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cook more. I no longer live in the city and should theoretically be forced to cook more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read more. I&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to find a backup from when I first created the blog with Gatsby version2, but I had to upgrade everything that has changed in the past 3 years to version 5 of Gatsby... and I ended up overhauling the whole blog and hosting it on Gatsby Cloud instead of Github pages. So now, we get pictures!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;January&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a crazy time. Sami and I had just signed our lease in Austin, Texas and I was coming back from a wedding in Tampa and flew straight to Colorado for a week-long snowboarding trip at Copper Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I flew back to LA for a couple of days, packed, and drove with my mom from LA to Austin over the course of 2 days. Thank you to everyone who contributed a song to the playlist, notably, &quot;All my exes live in Texas&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some friends invited me to Meanwhile Brewery on January 22nd, and I get in line for BBQ and happen to make it into a shot of Somebody Feed Phil for the Austin episode. You can catch my blue puffer jacket for a split second on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;February.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sami moved in we were busy setting up the apartment and meeting the doctors for our initial launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We bought couches and I got a really nice lazyboy chair off of craigslist, but I hadn&apos;t been working out in a while, and when I leaned over to pick up the chair in the seller&apos;s house, my pants ripped right down the middle. Very awkward carrying it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather warmed up and we got around to exploring the bars and downtown Austin. We left a little surprise on Rainey Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started doing an hourly bootcamp session Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday nights with James and Christine who were learning how to code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;April&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors gave us access to their data and we took turns sleeping to work around the clock for our data job uploads. Some of the jobs in the early days took multiple days to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew back into Virginia for a collegiate friend&apos;s wedding and was meeting up with some VA friends (Peter and Joyce) by Merrifield, when I coincidentally bumped into LA friends who happened to be in town to plan their own wedding! We were eventually joined by even more friends at Caboose, but what a nice surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a picture taken before a bunch of paid actors took over the scene and started dancing suggestively when all we wanted to do was chill in the sprinkles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first doctor agreed to do a paid trial with Moyae for a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coding bootcamp sessions with me concludes and I think I did a bad job because none in my tutelage got a job. But also, the software job market was not looking great. Maybe just 4 hour of classes a week with office hours on Sunday was not enough. They were supposed to be doing 30 hours a week on their own, but it made me wonder what it was like for kids who had to endure online learning during quarantine. I&apos;m sure I would&apos;ve found a way to not pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;June&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS accepted Moyae into its impact accelerator and we were given $225K total value between grants and credits to build out Moyae even further. Everything up to this point was being funded out of our personal pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of June, Sami and I flew to Seattle to attend the innaugral Amazon AWS accelerator and were treated to the best Seattle had to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to thank Amazon for the opportunity, I had to pay my respects to.. ahem. Jeff Bezo&apos;s two magnficient eco-friendly spheres. I got to catch up with friends in town, went on a date at the space needle, and experienced box suites and courtside seats at a WNBA game. I also happened to make an appearance on ESPN for a moment too, but I was too awestruck being courtside to notice until someone pointed it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a wedding back in VA and I had to clean up for a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned 32 and we celebrated by going out to Seoulju in Austin when I got back. However, celebrations were cut short because the first federal testing for Moyae was early in the morning the next day so I pulled a collegiate all nighter in a mad dash to be ready by 8am the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accelerator was an 8 week program and Sami and I had had business calls and code to fix everyday. We felt obligated to try and video call every investor Amazon had set us up with, even though VC economy was shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 16th, Honey Pig opened its doors in Austin, and I went to the opening week for a cousin&apos;s birthday.
The owner from Annandale was there! She didn&apos;t recognize me, but I&apos;d seen her enough times after college&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the last week of July, Sami and I were flown to New York to do &quot;Demo Day&quot; to about a hundred VC&apos;s and angels that AWS had curated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of restaurants and free food and networking and at some point during all the mayhem, I found myself at a table at Club Marquee on a Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the AWS program concluded with &quot;yearbook&quot; signings, I crashed Dennis&apos;s living room in Brooklyn. We went out that night and met up with an old co-worker from Entermedicare.&lt;/p&gt;

oh. typical dennis. He&apos;s trying to convince me he won the bet that aliens with spaceships have definitely landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I borrowed Dennis&apos;s car early the next morning and drove 3 hours from NYC to Wildwood, NJ to play beach ultimate with the frisbee crew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I drove back into NYC that night, I managed to catch another friend who was visiting the city from VA one last time before his daughter was born. I was a bit too late to grab drinks, but we got meat skewers from a vendor in Chinatown and ate them at an empty park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;August&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors were done with the paid trial and said that they needed our software to do twice as much. The medical side was looking good, but it was a pain to do billing translations from our app into their current old system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for them to switch, we needed to also build out revenue management and appointment scheduling. Easy enough we said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sami and planned out what our next 3 months would look like. In the evenings when I had a couple minutes I&apos;d play Hades and eventually beat the underworld god with three lives. I fell in love with the Good Riddance song that Eurydice sings in Tartarus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played in Austin&apos;s summer league and my team finished first in the tournament. This is probably my first win in 7 years. I think the last time I&apos;d won a tournament was when we were trial testing Lord Club for Fairfax, and I didn&apos;t even try out when the team was made back then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex came and visited for a weekend and we got free fried ice cream for Sami&apos;s birthday. I have hardly any pictures from this month because we were so busy. Alex and I took a selfie and that was it for the entire month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the weeks were so long. It was normal for us to be working from 9am until 2am every single day. We had hired on contractors from overseas to make the money Amazon had given us last longer, so I sometimes needed to field and answer questions when their mornings started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;September&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn&apos;t taken a weekend off since the Wildwood weekend and a couple hours off for a birthday dinner early in August so I bought tickets to LA for 3 days to visit some friends I said goodbye to when I moved. It was my first &amp;#x3C; 50hr week since end of July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We danced to Moe Shop and Yung Bae and we ate so many noodles, skewers, and tacos. I flew back to Austin on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addison came to visit from Fredericksburg and while I had to work most of the day while he was in town, we still managed to do some exploring and a rage room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of September, Sami and I travelled to Chicago to AAO, the American Academy of Ophthalmology convention. It seemed like every ophthalmologist in the world was there, and the biggest players in the eye space had fancy booths. We learned McCormick Convention center was MASSIVE and got to demo to a few strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

And this is what an eye doctor&apos;s dealers room looks like. I&apos;d only ever been to anime and pop culture ones!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also bought a fish tank when I got back to Austin because I saw a deal on craigslist. so now I had a roommate: Bruce the Betta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;October&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to dogsit Nick, a very good boi, for a week while my cousin was out of town for a wedding. It was very hard to code for 3-4 hours at a time when someone wags their tail at you looking like this asking to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of October I flew back to VA for a week to attend two weddings back to back and catch up with Virginia friends. I got completely obsessed with the anime Cyberpunk Edgerunners somewhere in the blur and could not stop listening to a soundtrack from the game / show &quot;I really want to stay at your house&quot; by Rosa Walton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;November&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November was a lot of preparation to certification ready for our December test dates. I did manage to sneak out and go to Wurstfest and eat bratwursts and drink german beer early on a Saturday morning. It was a long drive to get there, and I remember spending too much time at a Buccee&apos;s on the way back and missing a meeting Sami and I had planned for 4pm in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crazy coincidence also happened when I went to see Jimmy O Yang&apos;s netflix taping in Austin. Sami and I arrived 30 minutes late because of a bug for work, but the show was also delayed, so we got in on time. Our assigned seats just happened to be next to my cousins and their SO&apos;s at the paramount theatre. Sami thought we&apos;d planned it, we were all very surprised and amused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sami and I took Thanksgiving night off at a friend&apos;s place in Round Rock watching some old-fashioned American football and chicken from HEB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;December&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed a new lease in Lamar by my rock climbing gym. I missed a lot of the asian eats from Ktown in LA so I wanted to be closer to some of the pochas that I liked... like SOHA Bar. I forgot all about Cyberpunk Edgerunners when I started watching Arcane. I apologize to all the League fans I&apos;ve offended over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moyae passed 3/4 major certifications, with the 4th one missed because of a third party vendor that forgot to do an update. We are scheduled for another retest date Jan 3rd, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals and resolutions met&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are missing some context from the previous two years, one of my goals was to get stronger. I got back into rock climbing again early in the summer and started weight-lifting again. I was able hit my goal of 3-reps at 135lbs (i weigh 125lbs), but it was tough. Props to everyone who sticks with weight-lifting but it is not nearly as fun as climbing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to climb some v6&apos;s this year. I hadn&apos;t been able to do that consistently before, however, I think this goal is a little cheated because i suspect the routes here are easier than the ones in LA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hit my goal in chess. By playing each night, I finally got my rank from 1300 to a peak of 1622 on lichess. I still only have two openers, but the King&apos;s Gambit is my favorite opener on white. I find the bishop sacrifice to weaken the opponent position so early in the game a fun and defiant move for people around my skill bracket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Goals missed:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only read 1 book this year. My usual goal is to read 3-4 books a year, but I found my evenings playing Dota2 when I had more than an hour before bed and chess when I had about 30 minutes. I did also subscribe to shounen jump, which to my surprise was only $1.99 a month, and was a much faster way to be in the know about Chainsawman, Jujitsu Kaisen, the Promised Neverland, and Tokyo Ghoul than spending 25 min per episode. I typically read through the chapters in about 3 minutes. Do full manga series count?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New Goals for 2023&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a half marathon. (don&apos;s accidentally oversleep and miss the race this time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Climb a V7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn a new song on the piano. ( I still only know Wedding Dress by Taeyang )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try wakeboarding (never done it before)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read some more books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write more. (i always say this, but it&apos;ll happen this time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Top Songs for 2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really want to stay at your house, Rosa Walton&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good Riddance, Ashley Barrett&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&apos;ve got your whole life head of you baby, IDER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel your love, Luli Lee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cbb to b sad, IDER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animal Spirits, Vulfpeck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Predictions for 2023&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Altcoins will all die. Even if there are a few good projects out there, it is now hard to shake the perception of an industry and tech full of scammers. I think Bitcoin will rise by the end of 2023 as global tensions continue to rise and food scarcity is a topic again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuclear Fusion startups are all the rage on all news channels and magazines in order to assuage doom and gloom and they&apos;ll promise a new era of humanity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the start of 2014, I predicted that if they took Crimea, Russia would be emboldened to take Bulgaria by 2020. I was wrong, instead it was February of 2022, before Russia invaded their own neighbors. I thought they&apos;d be greedier. I think China is inspired and will forcibly take TSMC from Taiwan for its chip manufacturing in 2023, but this will not cause a war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing my prediction from 2014, I think India&apos;s space program will do well and they will announce a manned trip to the moon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think by the end of 2023 we will hear more financial worries for Toyota and Honda and the Japanese in general and this will be the start of the EV movement mass produced by South Korea and Vietnam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Judy Faulkner of EPIC systems turns 80 and announces her retirement and hands the company to her children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I believe the prolonged &quot;sustainable&quot; war will continue in Ukraine until near elections 2024, so nothing new will happen in 2023. Then we may either hear about double agents in Russia fall off hotel balconies or someone new rise up in power.&lt;/li&gt;

The bridge of my nose is a bit sore from the chinese knockoff N95 mask I promised Mom I&apos;d wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the saddest looking burrito from a Moe&apos;s and I watched a racist Karen get kicked off a plane headed to Tulsa, OK. She demanded she be reimbursed, wanted a hotel, and pulled her mask off and coughed at the gate attendant. When airport security came to arrest her, she started crying. Maybe I&apos;m no better. Afterall, a good libtard should be at home, curtains drawn when not protesting. Here I am at the airport... going home to see friends and family. Living in Los Angeles has no merits when both the Hollywood and Michelin stars are permanently closed. I&apos;ve been working from home since late February. Almost half a year indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently in the past 6 weeks, I&apos;ve gotten into outdoor climbing. I&apos;ll head up 2-3 times a week from Culver City up to Stoney Point, where in the documentary Valley Uprising, the origins of rockclimbing took its roots. It feels good to know at least with this, I&apos;m following in the footsteps of some great leaders. With all the gyms closed this year, I&apos;ve been a part of the Great Muscle Deflation that&apos;s hit this country as bad as the recent increase in inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t think I&apos;d ever get to this point, but I think I&apos;ve played an entire lifetime&apos;s worth of video games and I don&apos;t really find them to have the same appeal. Maybe my Buddhist moderation has really kicked in. Maybe I&apos;m just bad at Dota and am tired of losing. At any rate, I&apos;ve uninstalled most of my games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading Viet Thanh Nguyen&apos;s The Sympathizer. I originally bought it to read on this trip, but I cheated and read a few pages before the trip and was hooked. I don&apos;t know why I am so enthralled by the revolutionary. I love Gurren Lagann, Akame Ga Kill, Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Princess Leia. Hah. Maybe it&apos;s just a wish that the underdog gets a more equal share. Maybe i wished ultimate frisbee could get more playing time on the fields, but we can&apos;t because we&apos;re not considered a &quot;real&quot; or a &quot;primary&quot; sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of the revolutionary&apos;s job is to convince their peers that the cause is worth it. Maybe that is why I like startups. The founding members are no different than cult leaders. Maybe the only difference is that the founders do not convene with God. Maybe they do... WeWork was almost granted divinity next to the holiest Apple and Google and Facebook and Netflix. And at wework, CEO worship was mandatory. But it&apos;s grueling work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&apos;m going home to Virginia. I need to figure out if I should go home to NOVA, Travel the world during a pandemic, settle down in the south and get a dog, or start my own business. I like my current job, and they&apos;ve allowed me to work remotely. But my rent in LA is very high. I could just be a big fish in a small pond. No need to have to live near Kylie Jenner. At the end of the day I&apos;m only a step further in this climb. I need to kick it in gear to do a full send.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Responsible Growing]]></title><description><![CDATA[It takes courage to try something new, I used to inspire others to break their comfort zone, Ninety-nine problems, but I'm not alone, Put my…]]></description><link>https://dougphung.com/responsible-growing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://dougphung.com/responsible-growing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 05:54:28 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It takes courage to try something new,&lt;br&gt;
I used to inspire others to break their comfort zone,&lt;br&gt;
Ninety-nine problems,&lt;br&gt;
but I&apos;m not alone,&lt;br&gt;
Put my heart on the line, dance to the music,&lt;br&gt;
Now I&apos;m becoming real again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Mama said to take care of myself and help others in need,&lt;br&gt;
So put the excuses back on the shelf,&lt;br&gt;
and put one foot in front the other towards a new goal,&lt;br&gt;
Even the airlines say help yourself before the others.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dont be afraid of the unknown,&lt;br&gt;
Creating hope used to be my philosophy,&lt;br&gt;
A navy seal told me,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If you want to change the world,&lt;br&gt;
Swim with the sharks and make your bed regularly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now I&apos;m stepping outside my comfort zone again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Gravity exists because it&apos;s afraid of letting go,&lt;br&gt;
but the natural state of man is to be free.&lt;br&gt;
So I believe it&apos;s okay to push the status quo,&lt;br&gt;
But first, don&apos;t forget to take care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wasted Time]]></title><description><![CDATA[Why get out of bed?

If you don&apos;t make promises,&lt;br&gt;

I bought this domain for 5 years. The Chinese aren&apos;t stealing dougphung.com again for awhile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh woe. 2019 was exciting, with lots of ups and lots of downs.
I said good-bye to so many good friends back in DC, and I&apos;ve made a few friends in LA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love wasn&apos;t in the Californian air when I got here. And I experienced a lay-off / firing for the first time. But 2 weeks later I had a new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January&lt;/strong&gt;-Went snowboarding with the bestest of friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February&lt;/strong&gt;-Submitted my two weeks notice to Capital One. Crystal moved to LA. I slept on an air mattress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March&lt;/strong&gt;-I had two final round interviews in California, but it didn&apos;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April&lt;/strong&gt;-I drove cross-country with my Dad across America. Visited some great friends along the way and saw family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May&lt;/strong&gt;-Got a job at a luxury real estate startup making a website engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June&lt;/strong&gt;-Went bottom-fishing on a boat and caught the limit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July&lt;/strong&gt;-Sarah and friends were in town for Anime Expo. 7.4 earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August&lt;/strong&gt;-Celebrated the release of v3 at work by parting at Kylie Jenner&apos;s new house (the startup had the real estate agent&apos;s keys), but I was let go the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September&lt;/strong&gt;-Started working at EnterMedicare, a medicare startup. Started learning more indepth about America&apos;s healthcare environment. Got to visit home for a week before I started and played the first week of Fairfax Ultimate&apos;s Fall League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October&lt;/strong&gt;-James Lee came down. and Jtow came to visit and we drove down to see USAU club nationals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November&lt;/strong&gt;-Thanksgiving was spent with Cousins down in Long Beach. Shut down Wishpanda. Attended my first NBA game. Clippers vs Trailblazers @StapleCenter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December&lt;/strong&gt;-Crystal and I broke up after 3 years 11 months. Spent Christmas surfing in El Salvador and Costa Rica while attending Nga and Pete&apos;s 25th anniversary vow renewal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books Read This Year&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Testament of Hope: Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animal Farm, George Orwell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinventing American Health Care, Ezekiel J. Emanuel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Songs of 2019&lt;/strong&gt; (not repeating the 2018 ones):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izRqdNeTYbE&quot;&gt;You&apos;ve Got Your Whole Life Ahead Of You, IDER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izRqdNeTYbE&quot;&gt;Sun In our Eyes, MØ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OFv566mj7s&quot;&gt;Rainbow, Kacey Musgraves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ1OGXxb6PM&quot;&gt;Winnebago, Gryffin ft. Quinn XCII, Daniel Wison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM-BakWpN4k&quot;&gt;Cinnamon Girl, ASL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send Me Off, Bastille. Added this last minute because I played it while writing this. Actually, the entirety of Golden Hour by Kacey Musgraves is good. I also really like the title Space Cowboy since it feels so Cowboy Bebop, even though it isn&apos;t jazz funk. It reminds me of Julia Blues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolutions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&apos;t get as strong as I wanted to, but I did lift more weights in 2019. I think I may try a personal trainer in 2020. But I resolve to be stronger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed El Salvador and the hostels in Costa Rica. I will try to travel solo again in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I miss ultimate frisbee. I will play more. Beach Pickups, here I come!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to blog more often. My instagram daily posts only worked for 30-odd days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore more of LA. I haven&apos;t been to a concert here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictions and Politics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 I predicted we&apos;d have a half asian woman president for 2020. I&apos;m beginning to think Bernie-Warren with Yang ideas is the best I&apos;m going to get. But I also predicted war starting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America&apos;s started the year with assassinations. Let us remember Asimov, &quot;Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent&quot;. Here&apos;s to getting through the year with minimal bloodshed globally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
