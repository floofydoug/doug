A year ago I hoped for 2020 to a year with nominal bloodshed. We didn’t lose a lot of blood, we simply just lot a lot of lives to Covid-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year started off awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January&lt;/strong&gt; - Iranian Assassination. Australian Fires. Apartment shopping. RIP Kobe. Trump tries to replace NAFTA. Our startup had to pivot because a big contract we were expecting to get signed fell through. I’m starting to pack my stuff from Overland into boxes.
&lt;strong&gt;February&lt;/strong&gt; - Dennis is in town to shoot an episode of Hot Seat. Naomi, Dennis and I get Popeyes and see Darude play Sandstorm. We hear about Covid in the US for the first time. I move to my new apartment on Valentine’s Day and try to get everything set up before I fly back to VA for Justin and Whitney’s wedding.
&lt;strong&gt;March&lt;/strong&gt; -  No toilet paper. I had a ski trip planned with a coworker in Tahoe, but we only got to snowboard once because the resorts shutdown in response to the virus. I also miss my flight back because of excess snow. Grandma dies. Stocks start to fall. I officially start WFH for good and I start learning how to play Rocket League and Dungeons and Dragons. My portfolio looks absolutely terrible and I start to doubt whether or not cryptocurrencies are viable at all because they’ve fallen directly with the current market.
&lt;strong&gt;April&lt;/strong&gt; - Some online friends whom I have never met in real life mail me toilet paper! Praise all Dungeons and Dragons friend groups. WFH and lockdowns ensue. I print out a large Fairfax County map to go along with my parks map that Vivian sent me. I try to grow some bonsai trees that Bernard sent me and I kill them all. Bernard and Andrea gets married.
&lt;strong&gt;May&lt;/strong&gt; - started off pretty strong! While Covid was raging, scientists found a way to stop the spread of Malaria! But then it looked like China was going to war with India for a moment and then there was the murder of George Floyd. There were riots in LA and I’d wake up in the middle of the night to helicopters yelling at people on Venice Blvd. I buy a piano.
&lt;strong&gt;June&lt;/strong&gt; - Elon Musk and his team is Atlas bearing the weight of human paralysis and launches 60 satellates for Starlink. TSLA stock is infallible, being above 1K for the first time. I manage to lose 8K in options trading on Robinhood when everything seemed to be going back up. BLM still protesting. I drive down to Lake Forest to celebrate Lynsa’s birthday and write letters back to friends and family at home. Dgon invited me to check out the death of OGN Gaming during their liquidation sale and I purchase two Secret Labs chairs for $50 and an Uplift Desk for $200. I start rock climbing outdoors with Daniel Bui and my indoor rock climbing subscription starts sneakily charging me again even though they were only open for a week before closures again. I learn to play happy birthday on the piano to play for myself in a minor key.
&lt;strong&gt;July&lt;/strong&gt; - I’m convinced Putin will be ruler for life. I get really into rock climbing. I’m going whenever i get an invite and I still haven’t sent my first climb yet, but 6 months of sloth and gluttony is hard to shake off. Mom sends me ramen in a care package and I didn’t eat it because it’s such a nice thoughtful gift from Mom.
&lt;strong&gt;August&lt;/strong&gt; - I buy my own crashpad so I can start climbing multiple times a week on my own. I start sending my first v1s this time. Crystal and Elbert join me for some of my trips. One day I get really sunburnt at Manhatten beach, and I get inspired to go home after a couple video call sessions with Matt, James, Vivian and Ivy. I think I felt a little homesick and I’d been looking at a lot of property in Virginia as well as ideating on an idea to ship quarters to people in quarantine with fresh ones from the mint. I quarantine at Sami’s and we have a lot of fun playing minecraft and catching up and ideating new startups. The trip is fun, but I realize everyone’s dealing with the virus differently and Virginia isn’t so fun anymore. My friends don’t hang out with each other anymore and are moving on with life. But I don’t make this conclusion before buying a bike, fixing it and asking Vivian to hang out one last time to see if this could ever work. I give up. Work sends me an amazing cake to celebrate my 1 year.
&lt;strong&gt;September&lt;/strong&gt; - On the way back to LA, I start downloading a bunch of dating apps. I’d just seen my parents. I can be more outgoing and still be mostly responsible as long as I get tested regularly. I visit Lamanh’s place in the Art’s District and accidentally drive through Skid Row. I help test Crystal’s online shop and Alex Craven visits me in LA. We purchase edibles and marijuana for the first time in CA and I get stung by a bee on the throat. Online dating is pretty fun. I brought a girl to Stoney to climb and she ended up going home with a different guy! I start playing more tennis. Hang outs with Susie, Stephanie, and Jimmy. Suga replaces Abe Shinzo but continues Abeconomics in Japan. World covid death-toll at 1,000,0000 dead. I hit Plat in Rocket League.
&lt;strong&gt;October&lt;/strong&gt; - Lamanh and Alex come out to climb. Jacinda Adern wins New Zealand’s hearts. Susie introduces me to a climber friend who is my current go-to climbing buddy. Uncle Pete buys CovidDefeatsTrump.com, I get my California Real Id, I go on my third date with Erica, and Arivan visits me and we go climbing. He’s missing some teeth from a surfing accident a week prior. I learn that the rest of the engineering team is leaving to start their own companies. I convince Sami to fly out to interview with Entermedicare. Sami accepts the offer, and we celebrate by playing Civ 6 and dressing up in Kigus to buy weed on Halloween. My boss and CEO at Entermedicare decides to be patient 0 for Moderna Vaccine trials.
&lt;strong&gt;November&lt;/strong&gt; - I regret not investing in Moderna. Iran’s top nuclear scientist is assassinated. I climb with Chris and attempt my first v3. Erica invites to me a cabin in the woods to try mushrooms for a spiritial experience with a shaman. Im convinced it is a cult trying to kill me and I go. I survive. Work transitions as I feel like I’m the only engineer on the team. Sami starts the week before Thanksgiving. Spend Thanksgiving with Erica and her friends. We buy food from Whole Foods deli (their thanksgiving food is actually delicious). My aunt and uncle in Lake Forest contract covid.
&lt;strong&gt;December&lt;/strong&gt; - A more infectious strain of covid is found. Bitcoin &gt; 30K. I go snowboarding with Alex Craven and a former marine in Colorado. Both Libertarians. EnterMedicare raises another small 3M round. I fly home and quarantine with Sami and surprise my parents for Christmas Eve after getting a test. Nashville gets hit with a small bomb. And as a small way to end 2020, I get a speeding ticket going to the airport, Dennis hits a garage door during a test drive, Erica gets a flat tire, her friend is towed, and I had to jumpstart her prius today! I foresee lots of car issues into 2021!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: January 2021 - turns out the startup I’m in is also is looking to get acquired. I’m not out of a job yet, but things are looking a bit rocky. I may try to use this time to work on my own ideas. $GME is a class war!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resolutions for 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn to cook 1 new item a month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to run a business.&lt;/li&gt;

The bridge of my nose is a bit sore from the chinese knockoff N95 mask I promised Mom I’d wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the saddest looking burrito from a Moe’s and I watched a racist Karen get kicked off a plane headed to Tulsa, OK. She demanded she be reimbursed, wanted a hotel, and pulled her mask off and coughed at the gate attendant. When airport security came to arrest her, she started crying. Maybe I’m no better. Afterall, a good libtard should be at home, curtains drawn when not protesting. Here I am at the airport… going home to see friends and family. Living in Los Angeles has no merits when both the Hollywood and Michelin stars are permanently closed. I’ve been working from home since late February. Almost half a year indoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently in the past 6 weeks, I’ve gotten into outdoor climbing. I’ll head up 2-3 times a week from Culver City up to Stoney Point, where in the documentary Valley Uprising, the origins of rockclimbing took its roots. It feels good to know at least with this, I’m following in the footsteps of some great leaders. With all the gyms closed this year, I’ve been a part of the Great Muscle Deflation that’s hit this country as bad as the recent increase in inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t think I’d ever get to this point, but I think I’ve played an entire lifetime’s worth of video games and I don’t really find them to have the same appeal. Maybe my Buddhist moderation has really kicked in. Maybe I’m just bad at Dota and am tired of losing. At any rate, I’ve uninstalled most of my games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading Viet Thanh Nguyen’s The Sympathizer. I originally bought it to read on this trip, but I cheated and read a few pages before the trip and was hooked. I don’t know why I am so enthralled by the revolutionary. I love Gurren Lagann, Akame Ga Kill, Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Princess Leia. Hah. Maybe it’s just a wish that the underdog gets a more equal share. Maybe i wished ultimate frisbee could get more playing time on the fields, but we can’t because we’re not considered a “real” or a “primary” sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of the revolutionary’s job is to convince their peers that the cause is worth it. Maybe that is why I like startups. The founding members are no different than cult leaders. Maybe the only difference is that the founders do not convene with God. Maybe they do… WeWork was almost granted divinity next to the holiest Apple and Google and Facebook and Netflix. And at wework, CEO worship was mandatory. But it’s grueling work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I’m going home to Virginia. I need to figure out if I should go home to NOVA, Travel the world during a pandemic, settle down in the south and get a dog, or start my own business. I like my current job, and they’ve allowed me to work remotely. But my rent in LA is very high. I could just be a big fish in a small pond. No need to have to live near Kylie Jenner. At the end of the day I’m only a step further in this climb. I need to kick it in gear to do a full send.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Responsible Growing]]></title><description><![CDATA[It takes courage to try something new, I used to inspire others to break their comfort zone, Ninety-nine problems, but I’m not alone, Put my…]]></description><link>http://www.dougphung.com/responsible-growing/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.dougphung.com/responsible-growing/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 09 Mar 2020 05:54:28 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It takes courage to try something new,&lt;br&gt;
I used to inspire others to break their comfort zone,&lt;br&gt;
Ninety-nine problems,&lt;br&gt;
but I’m not alone,&lt;br&gt;
Put my heart on the line, dance to the music,&lt;br&gt;
Now I’m becoming real again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Mama said to take care of myself and help others in need,&lt;br&gt;
So put the excuses back on the shelf,&lt;br&gt;
and put one foot in front the other towards a new goal,&lt;br&gt;
Even the airlines say help yourself before the others.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dont be afraid of the unknown,&lt;br&gt;
Creating hope used to be my philosophy,&lt;br&gt;
A navy seal told me,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;If you want to change the world,&lt;br&gt;
Swim with the sharks and make your bed regularly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now I’m stepping outside my comfort zone again.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Gravity exists because it’s afraid of letting go,&lt;br&gt;
but the natural state of man is to be free.&lt;br&gt;
So I believe it’s okay to push the status quo,&lt;br&gt;
But first, don’t forget to take care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wasted Time]]></title><description><![CDATA[Why get out of bed?

I bought this domain for 5 years. The Chinese aren’t stealing dougphung.com again for awhile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh woe. 2019 was exciting, with lots of ups and lots of downs.
I said good-bye to so many good friends back in DC, and I’ve made a few friends in LA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love wasn’t in the Californian air when I got here. And I experienced a lay-off / firing for the first time. But 2 weeks later I had a new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January&lt;/strong&gt;-Went snowboarding with the bestest of friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February&lt;/strong&gt;-Submitted my two weeks notice to Capital One. Crystal moved to LA. I slept on an air mattress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March&lt;/strong&gt;-I had two final round interviews in California, but it didn’t work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April&lt;/strong&gt;-I drove cross-country with my Dad across America. Visited some great friends along the way and saw family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May&lt;/strong&gt;-Got a job at a luxury real estate startup making a website engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June&lt;/strong&gt;-Went bottom-fishing on a boat and caught the limit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July&lt;/strong&gt;-Sarah and friends were in town for Anime Expo. 7.4 earthquake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August&lt;/strong&gt;-Celebrated the release of v3 at work by parting at Kylie Jenner’s new house (the startup had the real estate agent’s keys), but I was let go the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September&lt;/strong&gt;-Started working at EnterMedicare, a medicare startup. Started learning more indepth about America’s healthcare environment. Got to visit home for a week before I started and played the first week of Fairfax Ultimate’s Fall League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October&lt;/strong&gt;-James Lee came down. and Jtow came to visit and we drove down to see USAU club nationals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November&lt;/strong&gt;-Thanksgiving was spent with Cousins down in Long Beach. Shut down Wishpanda. Attended my first NBA game. Clippers vs Trailblazers @StapleCenter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December&lt;/strong&gt;-Crystal and I broke up after 3 years 11 months. Spent Christmas surfing in El Salvador and Costa Rica while attending Nga and Pete’s 25th anniversary vow renewal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Books Read This Year&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Testament of Hope: Writings and Speeches of Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Animal Farm, George Orwell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinventing American Health Care, Ezekiel J. Emanuel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite Songs of 2019&lt;/strong&gt; (not repeating the 2018 ones):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izRqdNeTYbE&quot;&gt;You’ve Got Your Whole Life Ahead Of You, IDER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izRqdNeTYbE&quot;&gt;Sun In our Eyes, MØ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OFv566mj7s&quot;&gt;Rainbow, Kacey Musgraves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ1OGXxb6PM&quot;&gt;Winnebago, Gryffin ft. Quinn XCII, Daniel Wison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM-BakWpN4k&quot;&gt;Cinnamon Girl, ASL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send Me Off, Bastille. Added this last minute because I played it while writing this. Actually, the entirety of Golden Hour by Kacey Musgraves is good. I also really like the title Space Cowboy since it feels so Cowboy Bebop, even though it isn’t jazz funk. It reminds me of Julia Blues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolutions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn’t get as strong as I wanted to, but I did lift more weights in 2019. I think I may try a personal trainer in 2020. But I resolve to be stronger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed El Salvador and the hostels in Costa Rica. I will try to travel solo again in 2020.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I miss ultimate frisbee. I will play more. Beach Pickups, here I come!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to blog more often. My instagram daily posts only worked for 30-odd days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explore more of LA. I haven’t been to a concert here!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictions and Politics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 I predicted we’d have a half asian woman president for 2020. I’m beginning to think Bernie-Warren with Yang ideas is the best I’m going to get. But I also predicted war starting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America’s started the year with assassinations. Let us remember Asimov, “Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent”. Here’s to getting through the year with minimal bloodshed globally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
